# Phalanx-Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks in Keras

Touchscreens are the most successful input method for smartphones. Despite their flexibility, touch input is limited to the location of taps and gestures. We present Phalanx Touch, an additional input modality that differentiates between touches of fingers and the phalanx. We present a use case for Phalanx Touch, including the use as a shortcut to open an application (for instance camera). To evaluate the use case, we have developed a model that differentiates between finger and phalanx touch with an accuracy of 98% in realistic scenarios. Results of the evaluation show that participants perceive the input modality as intuitive and natural to perform.
